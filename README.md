## Image Data

Whole slide images (WSIs) of murine kidney data are available at: http://bit.ly/3rdGPEd. Murine data includes whole kidney sections derived from both wild type and diseased mice across six mouse models [T2DM A, T2DM B, Aging, FSGS (SAND), HIVAN, Progeroid]. All kidney specimens were stained with p57kip2 immunohistochemistry and Periodic Acid-Schiff (without Hematoxylin counter stain) prior to digitization.
